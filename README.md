## Restfull API written in GO

Me trying to learn golang by coding a rest api using gorilla/mux and postgres.

### Todo:

* [ ] "/" => "Hello world!"
* [ ] Database
* [ ] Decide what X is
* [ ] Show X by index (GET)
* [ ] Show all X (GET)
* [ ] Create X (POST)
* [ ] Update X (PATCH/PUT?)
* [ ] Delete X (DELETE)
* [ ] Serve some static pages (home, error)
